YubiHSM for unix authentication.


Intro
=====
You can use YubiHSM to encrypt all your passwords using a key that's
only stored inside the YubiHSM. There is then no way to snarf
/etc/shadow and do offline password cracking.


Installation instructions
=========================

1. Set up your YubiHSM (if you haven't already)
-----------------------------------------------
(this is a quick rehash of chapter 8 of the YubiHSM reference manual)

Plug it in and run "minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0".

If the prompt is "HSM>" then it's already set up.

If the prompt is "WSAPI>" then it's in WSAPI mode. Run "hsm" and set
it up according to the instructions in chapter 8.4 of the YubiHSM
reference manual.

If you don't get a prompt at all, then unplug it and hold down the
configuration button while inserting it, and try again.


2. Set up a crypto key for YHSMPAM
----------------------------------
Go to the YubiHSM configuration mode (unplug, hold down config button
while re-inserting).

Run "minicom -D /dev/ttyACM0". You should get a "HSM>" prompt.

List your existing keys using "keylist". Either pick an existing key
number or generate a new using "keygen 8000 1 20" (to generate key
with handle 8000).

Type "exit" to make the YubiHSM go into HSM mode.


3. Configure YHSMPAM
--------------------
$ sudo mkdir -m 700 /etc/yhsmpam
$ sudo mkdir -m 700 /etc/yhsmpam/users
$ sudo tee /etc/yhsmpam/yhsmpam.conf > /dev/null
key_handle 8000
device /dev/ttyACM0
^D

If your YubiHSM is /dev/ttyACM0 then you can skip that in the
config. It's the default.

Mode 700 on the directories may prevent pam_externalpass from seeing
the user config files for some PAM-enabled programs such as su. A fix
is being worked on.


4. Set password for a test user
-------------------------------
First copy yhsmpam.py somewhere nice in your admin PATH, such as
/usr/local/sbin/yhsmpam (without .py). It will be used by the PAM
module, so don't put it in your home directory.

$ sudo yhsmpam set testuser
User password: secret


Verify that it was written:
$ sudo cat /etc/yhsmpam/users/testuser
071234002600 3821309218309821038213218392103213123123ee12312893182903


5. Test the password
--------------------
% sudo yhsmpam check testuser
User password: secret
Password correct


6. Install pam_externalpass
---------------------------
Compile and install pam_externalpass:
<https://github.com/ThomasHabets/pam_externalpass>

  git clone https://github.com/ThomasHabets/pam_externalpass.git
  cd pam_externalpass
  ./configure
  make
  make install


7. Configure PAM
----------------
Add this to /etc/pam.d/common-auth before the pam_unix line:
  auth sufficient /usr/local/lib/libpam_externalpass.so \
             exec=/usr/local/sbin/yhsmpam \
             prompt=HSM_Password:_ \
             userconf=/etc/yhsmpam/users/%u


8. Try logging in as the test user
----------------------------------
Use ssh, su or whatever. If you put the line in /etc/pam.d/common-auth
it should work for everything (except su, see above).
